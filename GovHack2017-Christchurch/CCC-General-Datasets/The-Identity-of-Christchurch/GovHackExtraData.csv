The Art Museum is a great resource as are the botanic gardens, but overall, Christchurch is not a world class city by any measure.",,

It doesn't feel like a place for ""my"" kind of people- the disenfranchised youth who are just sick of this whole ponzi scheme that is society (see; the Panama Papers etc etc).    My friends and I always used to hang out in Cashel St Mall, Cathedral Square (despite that incessant ringing...), the old Bus Exchange/Crossing, the Avon River, the Botanical Gardens, all over centre city. You probably saw us at some point 7+ years ago, at hack and all of that. There were hundreds of us at a time in its peak, and then you (the council) destroyed one of the only places we were welcomed. So we relocated to other parts of the city centre. This was all pre-quakes.    Today, the design of the city centre is not comfortable whatsoever. As I said, there is no semblance of organisation or any kind of remarkable aesthetics that the city used to have; just a randomised collection of old English architecture and ""modern"" glass-dominated corporate-oriented buildings.     If your intention was to drive the youth out, you've succeeded. Congratulations. Good job on contributing to part of the drug epidemic, by keeping out a large group of disenfranchised youth and alienating us even further than we were before. And you wonder why Chch has a massive rate of youth unemployment, drug addiction and basically a crime epidemic? The whole system is an absolute joke, and it all starts at home and goes up from the hierarchy from there, getting worse as you climb the capitalist ladder."

Neither agree nor disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,,,"Moved from Central Christchurch to get away from the awful mess of the rebuild and demolition around us and the lack of interest from the Council to oversee the work going on or provide information on rebuilds in our area.  Total dismay at the lack of urgency in the rebuild of the Central City which has made many of our neighbours and ourselves to finally move away.  The biggest exodus of people from Christchurch since the February earthquake we were told by the removal firms we got quotes for.  It would be good if the Council focused on the present rather than planning for 10, 20 or 30 years ahead.  They have let the people of Christchurch down.  Cycleways should not be a priority, only a few hundred people will use them certainly not tourists.  Convention Centre and Rugby Stadium bring more tourists into the city.  Our children were not interested in coming for Christmas, too depressing.  So all the investment seems to have come from private developers with mixed results.  So its a work in slow progress.","Living in Central City, most of our neighbours had left and rented their houses out, others have waited years for their houses to be repaired.  Often repairs take years as contractors are covering many repairs. So population is transient.  "

I do not think the average retiree finds it a great place to be. The cathedral is a mess, the arguments go on, we must do something with it or the square will become a cold, windy ghetto. Who in their right minds wants to go through there? I do have the need to remember the cathedral but to rebuild it from what it is now is a totally ridiculous option. In London I came across an area that is preserved with very thick glass style casing and the history of it all there for you to see. I think a small part of our cathedral should be 'de-loused, rats etc gone' and a small area covered in such a way. This shows NZ and Christchurch in particular DOES HAVE HISTORY..not as Europe and Britain does, but history all the same. Then, we start from scratch with a modern church if it is needed, which I do not think it is. Just having the old one AS IT IS shows we respect the past, engage the future, and move on. Clearly the community are sick to death of the arguments and this does both jobs. Tourists would come to the square to see what is left, cost blow-outs would be restricted to preparation of the cleansing of the rats etc residing there, taggers works would not stick there and could be hosed off plus they would be seen as it is clear all around...it would suit the chalice being modern in attitude and new and lovely windbreaks, stores, information areas and free or 1 gold coin parking bays so you can go and look and visit stores  move off again... an hour max.   If you want to stay longer then park in a parking building and walk there...The square has always been a horrid cold place...it should be greener and pretty instead of neglected sad and sorry place....imagine that as the heart of the city????"

This is a big loss to Chch and needs to be remedied. The project in Victoria Sq, small amount of Maori art on display in the Bus Exchange and also in some tiling in the city is pitiful! The art gallery needs to stop collecting works from overseas and start giving scholarships to Maori and Pasifika artists to build up its profile as a South Pacific Art Gallery, not one in Europe.
